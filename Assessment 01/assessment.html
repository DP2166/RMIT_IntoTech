        <p> My full name is Phong Phu Nguyen, but I prefer to go by Dylan Nguyen. My family was originally from Vietnam but fled because of the Vietnam War. Wanting a better life, both my grandparents fled Vietnam when my parents were young, too young to even remember. I personally speck two language English is my main language and Vietnamese is my second language despite speaking Vietnamese first because of my grandparents, mostly being my caretaker while my parents were working. I started my primary experience in the year 2009 at <a title="Go to Bethany Catholic Primary School website" class="link_para" href="https://www.bswerribeenth.catholic.edu.au/">Bethany Catholic Primary School</a> finished in 2015 and attended high school from 2016 to 2021 at <a title="Go to Thomas Carr College website" class="link_para" href="https://www.thomascarr.vic.edu.au/">Thomas Carr College</a>. An interesting fact about myself is that I can do a stomach wave where I'm able to roll my abdomen, not many people know that talent because well not, but people would want to see my bare stomach. </p>


      <h2><a class="link_header" name="interest_IT" href="#home" title="Back to top"> Interest in IT </a></h2>


        <p> My interest in IT stem from my father being a computer programmer himself, so seeing him being able to tackling advance problems in my opinion but was far simple to him just interested me, being able to create programs that everyday people could use just showed me that I could do something helpful. Back in high school I did computing as a VCE subject, and I learnt some programming yet not too much as the teacher would be absent for half the year. In school I learnt a bit on HTML, mock-ups, networking and PC hardware and software.</p>

        <p> The reason why I chose RMIT to study my course is because traveling to RMIT from where I live is far easier than other university. It is also important to point out that RMIT is one of the best universities for technology (it does have Technology in its name 'Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology'). My cousin had recently graduated from RMIT studying computer science and had recommended it for me. </p>

        <p> I expect to learn some programming languages as well as be able to create a user-friendly experience as it would be interesting to me learn about everyday functions that we take for granted. such as messaging apps, we use them every day, yet we don't really know the amount of time and difficult it took just to create.</p>

    <h2><a class="link_header" name="ideal_job" href="#home" title="Back to top"> Ideal Job </a></h2>

      <p> An ideal job for me would be someone like <a title="Go to Michael Reeves's Youtube channel" class="link_para" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves"> Michael Reeves </a> or <a title="Go to Dougdoug's Youtube channel" class="link_para" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gloudas"> Dougdoug (Douglas Wreden) </a> where they are YouTube/content creator who are able to use their programming skills for entertainment. This job is appealing to me because it has so much freedom with it, from working on any project you want to being able to work from home or aboard, you are able to do a lot were as normal job you are forced to work a nine to five job which would be hard for me since I would get bored easily. </p>

      <p> The skills required wouldn't but too many, but some most notable skills would be communication, patience and problem solving. There isn't much experience required for the position but being able to get along with others is key to grow and improve. </p>

      <p> Skills I currently possess are being a comedian, would love to see myself as the comedian within my friend group. I am talented with math which would help in certain mathematical programs that needs calculations. Communication with friends is skill that comes naturally with me, so once I get to know the person chatting with them shouldn't be a problem. I remember things when it is visualised, so most of the program is written so it would be easier for me to remember certain codes. </p>

      <p> Ways I plan to improve upon my current skills to first continue studying information technology, this will allow me to continue to gain the skills of coding/programming as well as working on user-interfaces. With communication with strangers and people I'm not friends with is over time talking to people in the classes or people online. I would have to create new friends with them. This will break my fear of be an introvert. </p>

    <h2><a class="link_header" name="personal_profile" href="#home"  title="Back to top"> Personal profile </a></h2>


        <p> My results from the <a title="Go to Myers Briggs personality test website" class="link_para" href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"> Myers-Briggs </a> personality test are that I'm a 'Defender'. I have an introverted percentage of 66%, Observant percentage of 63%, Feeling percentage of 67%, Judging percentage of 56% and lastly Turbulent with a percentage of 58%. The result of a learning style test I did online from <a title="Go to How to study website" class="link_para" href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/">How to study</a> shows that I'm a 'visual' learner where I prefer learning in person and see graphs, task etc... First before knowing what to do. <a title="Go to The big five website" class="link_para" href="https://my-personality-test.com/big-5?gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPoZE5YKAPZ5QvNElhjZRF58wv_Krcs6jghN7T3jPso9jLgCXAFy40ehoCu5cQAvD_BwE"> The big five </a> personality test states that my 'extraversion' is medium which means that at times I enjoy being around others but at the same time I also enjoy being alone. 'Agreeableness' is medium, and it states others would describe me as friendly, helpful and would typically try and avoid conflict. 'Conscientiousness' is medium I'm able to have a balance between work and fun, I'm very reliable and hardworking along with my friendly and relaxing personality, makes the environment fun. 'Neuroticism' is medium, its states that I'm a realist and will try to do my best at everything even if there doesn't seem to be anything in it for me. My 'openness to experience' is low and states that I'm very dedicated to any work and always make sure to see the tasks through to the end. </p>

        <p> The result of the three test I've completed seems precise on the type of person I am, my thoughts and believes. From working hard, avoiding conflict to putting in my all is what I strive to be and hopefully am. With the results received by the test I work best when I'm with people I know and trust otherwise I wouldn't communicate as much since part of me is still an introvert. So, by being an introvert this would making working in a team hard as it would mean I'm limiting myself to working with friends. Yet working with me wouldn't be too hard as I'm an open person and is willing to hear the other person out on their thoughts and ideas. If I were to work with friends, I would be able to work in a relaxing environment which I could work at my optimal level and achieve a lot. </p>

      <h2><a class="link_header" name="project_idea" href="#home" title="Back to top"> Project Idea </a></h2>

        <h3> Overview </h3>

        <p> One IT project idea I have is to create a 'screen time' application where you can see your personal or even your kids screen time from your mobile phone to laptop and computer. If you download the application on those devices, you will be able to read the information that is transformed into easier readable information, in the form of visual data such as graphs and numbers. People would have to create accounts so that their data is saved, and this is how all devices are able to be linked together as it is under one account. One other important feature is that small family groups would be arranges so that if parents would want to monitor their child's screen time, then they are able to see the total amount of screen time they experience week/day (depends on the type of sorting you want). </p>

        <h3> Motivation </h3>

        <p> In the 21st century more technology is improving and are becoming essential in our everyday lives but too much screen time is not health as study shown it would "make it hard for your child to sleep at night" and "raise your child's risk for attention problems, anxiety, and depression". So, by developing this application people would be able to visually see their hours spend on their screens which would motivate them to decrease their usage of screen devices allowing people to spend on other needs. The main motivation behind this IT project is to make people realise the number of hours people spend on their screens every day. This is because majority of people think of mobile phone screen time and skip out on the screen time of spend on PCs, laptops, TVs, and consoles which could be a significant amount. </p>

        <h3> Description </h3>

        <p> I believe this IT project idea is important as it would allow everyday people to easily tell how much hours are spent on screen time. But when people ask for your screen time people would automatically think of your mobile phone screen time when they're completely forgetting about the screen time spend on laptops, PCs, TVs, and consoles. So, by coming up with an application that can be downloaded on multiple devices it could determine peoples actual screen time by displaying graphs that is colour coded to sort out which devices is which and as well as time spend on those certain apps. Within the app there would be a family group where clients are able to monitor those who is a part of the family pack. </p>

        <p> Potential drawbacks or obstacles that could cause problems would be creating a unique graph for each week that goes by. This is because it requires the need to code everything and somehow make a graph that is unique to each person all by itself. Another obstacle would be having to put in place an account mechanism that allows people to have an account, login and download the application on multiple devices so that the data would be more precise on reading the person's screen time since downloading the application on all devices and having an account would link everything together. </p>

        <p> Some extra features of the application that should be mentioned that could be proven beneficial is being given a choice to turn on reminders/notifications that the person had gone over their daily goal and should lower their usage. Another is making sure the colours used is clear, contrast and make sure that the colour-blinded are still able to see, able to still read the information on the colour coded graph still. One extra feature that could be controversial is after every week there would be a summary on what apps you would use most on. From hours on a particular game (shows what the game is) to what certain browser on the internet consumes the most time (like is it YouTube or Wikipedia). This function requires the user’s internet Brower's history which is against their privacy and would be in breach of the privacy law to it is an optional function that has to be enabled and part of the apps policy. So just like certain apps where when you first boot up the app there would be a policy page and a part where it asks if you would want the feature or not, users at that point would have the choice. </p>

        <p> The application would be available on many platforms that includes IOS, android, PCs, gaming consoles or even TVs if it allows us (having the app on gaming consoles and TVs would be hard to even impossible as it would require the TV to be able to run an application like this so somewhat new, and for consoles we would require the rights from Sony and Microsoft to give us the permission create such an application that could run on them.) </p>

        <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>

        <p> Software such as 'Visual Studio Code' would be a tremendous help to write the program for the application. Another software would be 'Proto.io'. Using this software, it would help plan out the mock-up of the application and depict what the user-interface should look life. It would be important to have a computer as well as two mobile device one with IOS the other with android as it would be able to be tested. Servers and databases are required so that customers can store their personal data/account saves, so that if a later date they require to look back on their data, then it is required to save that kind of information somewhere. </p>

        <h3> Skills Required </h3>

        <p> Knowing how to code is an important skill required as without it you wouldn't be able to program the system to do the task it requires. A simple software that could be written up is to begin with a simple counting program, where it starts to count when an application is opened. Being able to code is vastly difficult and could take years of experience, especially if it an application that monitors your time spent on different apps. Another skill needed is HTML as it is important for the user interface to look flashed out and easy to use as well as clear to understand, since it could instantly put customers off from further using the application. </p>

        <h3> Outcome </h3>

        <p> If the project were to be successful, then the outcome would be proven beneficial for everyone. The amount of screen time had drastically jumped during the pandemic and people may have gotten used to they're new habits such as gaming, bingeing shows or even browsing the web. With the app in place, it would help people realise the amount of time they spend on their screens in total. As well as have more people spending more time out an about outdoors, the government is still having trouble with the population going outdoors and spending money to increase the economy back to where it formally was before the pandemic. </p>
