    <h2> Ideal Job </h2>

      <p> An ideal job for me would be someone like <a title="Go to Michael Reeves's Youtube channel" class="link_para" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves"> Michael Reeves </a> or <a title="Go to Dougdoug's Youtube channel" class="link_para" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gloudas"> Dougdoug (Douglas Wreden) </a> where they are YouTube/content creator who are able to use their programming skills for entertainment. This job is appealing to me because it has so much freedom with it, from working on any project you want to being able to work from home or aboard, you are able to do a lot were as normal job you are forced to work a nine to five job which would be hard for me since I would get bored easily. </p>

      <p> The skills required wouldn't but too many, but some most notable skills would be communication, patience and problem solving. There isn't much experience required for the position but being able to get along with others is key to grow and improve. </p>

      <p> Skills I currently possess are being a comedian, would love to see myself as the comedian within my friend group. I am talented with math which would help in certain mathematical programs that needs calculations. Communication with friends is skill that comes naturally with me, so once I get to know the person chatting with them shouldn't be a problem. I remember things when it is visualised, so most of the program is written so it would be easier for me to remember certain codes. </p>

      <p> Ways I plan to improve upon my current skills to first continue studying information technology, this will allow me to continue to gain the skills of coding/programming as well as working on user-interfaces. With communication with strangers and people I'm not friends with is over time talking to people in the classes or people online. I would have to create new friends with them. This will break my fear of be an introvert. </p>
