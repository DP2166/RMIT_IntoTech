    <h2> Personal profile </h2>


        <p> My results from the <a title="Go to Myers Briggs personality test website" class="link_para" href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"> Myers-Briggs </a> personality test are that I'm a 'Defender'. I have an introverted percentage of 59%, Observant percentage of 73%, Feeling percentage of 70%, Judging percentage of 54% and lastly Turbulent with a percentage of 58%. The result of a learning style test I did online from <a title="Go to How to study website" class="link_para" href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/">How to study</a> shows that I'm a 'Tactile/kinesthetic' learner where I learn best when I can use the sense of touvh and can move about. So I can't sit still when learning but have to be doing something active. <a title="Go to The big five website" class="link_para" href="https://my-personality-test.com/big-5?gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPoZE5YKAPZ5QvNElhjZRF58wv_Krcs6jghN7T3jPso9jLgCXAFy40ehoCu5cQAvD_BwE"> The big five </a> personality test states that my 'extraversion' is medium which means that at times I enjoy being around others but at the same time I also enjoy being alone. 'Agreeableness' is medium, and it states others would describe me as friendly, helpful and would typically try and avoid conflict. 'Conscientiousness' is medium I'm able to have a balance between work and fun, I'm very reliable and hardworking along with my friendly and relaxing personality, makes the environment fun. 'Neuroticism' is medium, its states that I'm a realist and will try to do my best at everything even if there doesn't seem to be anything in it for me. My 'openness to experience' is medium and states that I'm very dedicated to any work and always make sure to see the tasks through to the end. </p>

        <p> The result of the three test I've completed seems precise on the type of person I am, my thoughts and believes. From working hard, avoiding conflict to putting in my all is what I strive to be and hopefully am. With the results received by the test I work best when I'm with people I know and trust otherwise I wouldn't communicate as much since part of me is still an introvert. So, by being an introvert this would making working in a team hard as it would mean I'm limiting myself to working with friends. Yet working with me wouldn't be too hard as I'm an open person and is willing to hear the other person out on their thoughts and ideas. If I were to work with friends, I would be able to work in a relaxing environment which I could work at my optimal level and achieve a lot. </p>
