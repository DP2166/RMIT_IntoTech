        <p> My full name is Phong Phu Nguyen, but I prefer to go by Dylan Nguyen. My family was originally from Vietnam but fled because of the Vietnam War. Wanting a better life, both my grandparents fled Vietnam when my parents were young, too young to even remember. I personally speck two language English is my main language and Vietnamese is my second language despite speaking Vietnamese first because of my grandparents, mostly being my caretaker while my parents were working. I started my primary experience in the year 2009 at <a title="Go to Bethany Catholic Primary School website" class="link_para" href="https://www.bswerribeenth.catholic.edu.au/">Bethany Catholic Primary School</a> finished in 2015 and attended high school from 2016 to 2021 at <a title="Go to Thomas Carr College website" class="link_para" href="https://www.thomascarr.vic.edu.au/">Thomas Carr College</a>. An interesting fact about myself is that I can do a stomach wave where I'm able to roll my abdomen, not many people know that talent because well not, but people would want to see my bare stomach. </p>


      <h2> Holidays I've been on </h2>
        <table style="font-size: 17pt; padding-left">
          <tr>
            <td> 

            <td> In total, I've travelled to aboard 7 times. Some trips were one of the best moments I've ever had while others were just a drag and getting there I already wanted to go home. My very first holiday was visiting family over in Vietnam, this was back in 2009 and lasted a whole month of my primary school prep year. I stayed there for a month for two weeks I was with my grandparents on my dad side while the other two weeks I was with my uncle, aunty, and cousins on my mum side. </td>

            <td> The second holiday my family went on was in Queensland Cairns 2012 when I was in year 3. The Cairns holiday consists of sight seeing the Daintree rainforest and snorkelling the great barrier reef. This was one of the holidays that I didn't really enjoy. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td> The next holiday was a boathouse trip I went with most of my mum side of the family to the Murry River during the holiday period of 2013 for 1 weeks. The whole trip we fished, built bonfires, and sail the boathouse. The family made it a fun experience. </td>

            <td> After the boathouse holiday my family went to the Gold Coast in 2014 with just the intermediate family. During that time, we went to all the theme parks around the area as well as go sightseeing 'Surfers Paradise'. It was during this trip I first experience teppanyaki, it was cool. </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td> The next trip was taking a trip on the 'Spirit of Tasmania' and going for a road trip through Tasmania from the top all the way down to Hobart. We made multiple stops from the 'Nant distillery' to local scenery, during the time my family went there was a local festival occurring which was quite fun at the time. </td>

            <td> My next trip was to America with my uncle, aunty and four of my cousins. It was a three-week holiday and is one of the BEST times I've ever had, I remember nearly everything that happened despite happening six years ago. On my holiday I went to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, and Dallas. </td>

            <td> The latest holiday I went to was Japan and this trip was tied with America being one of the best holidays I've been to. My family as well as my uncle, aunty and two cousins came along on the trip visiting Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. We went to many traditional landmarks from Kinkakujicho, Nara Park, went to the universal studios and travelled on the bullet train. The environment in Japan was one of the nicest places yet, would recommend. </td>
