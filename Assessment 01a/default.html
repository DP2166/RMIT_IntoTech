        <p> My full name is Phong Phu Nguyen, but I prefer to go by Dylan Nguyen. My family was originally from Vietnam but fled because of the Vietnam War. Wanting a better life, both my grandparents fled Vietnam when my parents were young, too young to even remember. I personally speck two language English is my main language and Vietnamese is my second language despite speaking Vietnamese first because of my grandparents, mostly being my caretaker while my parents were working. I started my primary experience in the year 2009 at <a title="Go to Bethany Catholic Primary School website" class="link_para" href="https://www.bswerribeenth.catholic.edu.au/">Bethany Catholic Primary School</a> finished in 2015 and attended high school from 2016 to 2021 at <a title="Go to Thomas Carr College website" class="link_para" href="https://www.thomascarr.vic.edu.au/">Thomas Carr College</a>. An interesting fact about myself is that I can do a stomach wave where I'm able to roll my abdomen, not many people know that talent because well not, but people would want to see my bare stomach. </p>
