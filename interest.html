      <h2> Interest in IT </h2>


        <p> My interest in IT stem from my father being a computer programmer himself, so seeing him being able to tackling advance problems in my opinion but was far simple to him just interested me, being able to create programs that everyday people could use just showed me that I could do something helpful. Back in high school I did computing as a VCE subject, and I learnt some programming yet not too much as the teacher would be absent for half the year. In school I learnt a bit on HTML, mock-ups, networking and PC hardware and software.</p>

        <p> The reason why I chose RMIT to study my course is because traveling to RMIT from where I live is far easier than other university. It is also important to point out that RMIT is one of the best universities for technology (it does have Technology in its name 'Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology'). My cousin had recently graduated from RMIT studying computer science and had recommended it for me. </p>

        <p> I expect to learn some programming languages as well as be able to create a user-friendly experience as it would be interesting to me learn about everyday functions that we take for granted. such as messaging apps, we use them every day, yet we don't really know the amount of time and difficult it took just to create.</p>
